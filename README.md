# 2048Game
This project implements the 2048 game like this one https://play2048.co/ but without GUI
This was one of my first projects in java and I have done it quite while ago. That being said, the project is not divided into classes properly.
However, it runs and implements the logic perfectly.

Future work:
-improve the design of the project by dividing the application into pieces and designing classes accordingly
-implement GUI
